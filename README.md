# Netflix-Statistical-Analysis

For this project, I conducted an exploratory analysis of the Netflix dataset as part of your coursework in Probability Theory and Introduction to Statistics class.

I started by getting a sense of the data, including its size, number of columns and rows, and data types.

Then, I created visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, scatterplots, and pie chart to represent the data and explore its distribution, relationships between variables, and outliers

I also obtained descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles to summarize the central tendency, spread, and variability of the data.

Finally, I found subsets of the data and obtained descriptive statistics for each subset, and created visualizations to represent the subset data.

Overall, my analysis provided insights into the Netflix dataset and helped me better understand its characteristics and patterns.
